Once the tracing is enabled, the Oracle HTTP Server will generate detailed trace information in the error log file. You can find the error log file location specified by the ErrorLog directive in the httpd.conf file.

Remember to disable the tracing (LogLevel back to warn or error) after you have completed your troubleshooting or diagnostic activities, as the extensive tracing may impact performance and generate large log files.

To disable trace in Oracle HTTP Server (OHS), you need to revert the changes made to the LogLevel directive. Follow these steps:

Locate the httpd.conf file: The httpd.conf file is the configuration file for Oracle HTTP Server. Find the file location based on your OHS installation. It is typically located in the $ORACLE_INSTANCE/config/OHS/<component_name>/ directory.

Open the httpd.conf file: Use a text editor to open the httpd.conf file.

Locate the LogLevel directive: Search for the LogLevel directive in the configuration file.

Set LogLevel to the desired value: Change the value of LogLevel back to the appropriate level you want to set. Common values are warn or error, which are the default values.

Save the changes: Save the modified httpd.conf file.

Restart Oracle HTTP Server: Restart the Oracle HTTP Server service to apply the changes. This can be done using the appropriate command or service manager for your operating system.

By setting the LogLevel directive to an appropriate value, you can disable the tracing in Oracle HTTP Server and revert to the normal logging behavior.

Remember to save the configuration changes and restart the server to apply the modifications.

To enable log rotation in Oracle HTTP Server (OHS), you can configure the log rotation settings in the httpd.conf file. Follow these steps:

Locate the httpd.conf file: The httpd.conf file is the configuration file for Oracle HTTP Server. Find the file location based on your OHS installation. It is typically located in the $ORACLE_INSTANCE/config/OHS/<component_name>/ directory.

Open the httpd.conf file: Use a text editor to open the httpd.conf file.

Find the log configuration section: Look for the section that configures the logging settings. It usually contains directives such as ErrorLog and CustomLog.

Enable log rotation for the desired log file: To enable log rotation, you need to configure the TransferLog or CustomLog directive for the specific log file you want to rotate. For example, if you want to enable log rotation for the error log, locate the ErrorLog directive.

Add the log rotation settings: Add the log rotation settings to the respective log directive. The log rotation settings typically include directives such as CustomLog "|rotatelogs /path/to/logfile.log 86400" common, where /path/to/logfile.log is the path to the log file, and 86400 is the rotation time interval in seconds (in this example, the rotation is set to occur daily).

Save the changes: Save the modified httpd.conf file.

Restart Oracle HTTP Server: Restart the Oracle HTTP Server service to apply the changes. This can be done using the appropriate command or service manager for your operating system.

By configuring the appropriate log rotation settings, you can ensure that log files in Oracle HTTP Server are rotated at regular intervals, preventing them from becoming too large and optimizing disk space usage.

Note: The log rotation settings may vary depending on the version and specific configuration of Oracle HTTP Server. Refer to the Oracle HTTP Server documentation or consult the relevant Oracle support resources for detailed instructions and specific configuration options related to log rotation.
